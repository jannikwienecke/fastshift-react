- [ ] open after creation, in config
- [ ] update design / message / icon of success notification
- [ ] way to show what fields are missing / errors in form
- [ ] add tipTap
- [ ] implement custom behaviour for combobox. E.g. Task -> Todos. Show only todos of that task. Updating the state of the task (completed / not completed)

## How we handle Deletes with soft delete

- project has many tasks, task has one project
- we "delete" a project, the task has still the reference but does not show it
- when we undelete the project, the task will show the project again
- same for projects when we "delete" a task (just filters out all the tasks that were deleted)

<!-- HIER WEITER MACHEN -->

## NEW TODOS

- [x] handle e.g. projects -> tasks list in detail
- [x] switching between views when we have a filter on one of the views -> error
- [x] filter in main tasks list -> effects list in projects -> task
- [x] when i set the project to a different one and its not in the list anymore -> remove optimistically
- [x] projects -> tasks should not be in sidebar of detail, tags should be (config )
- [x] not updating when convex db updates in task list view (only task view) (i think worked again)
- [x] leeren gruppen anzeigen/ausblenden. Blendet nicht alle richtig aus
- [x] i am on a custom view -> move to another view, filter etc. stays -> not correct!
- [x] local filtering for sub views not implemented
- [x] when i am at projects -> tasks, dont show the filter for projects and the grouping for projects
- [x] remove tasks from sidebar (with config)
- [x] when setting field from commandbar like email -> will not be validated
- [x] not everyting of the contextmenu list item is clickable
- [x] deleting "breaks" the app. Nothing is clickable
- [x] show deleted in sub view not working
- [x] should be "change category" in the combobox for project (we have always just one), update in test as well,
- [x] change commandbar item in sublist -> create new task in project. Preselect project.
- [x] if we are in projects -task, but create a task in a different project. should not be visible after creation
- [x] checkmark in combobox list
- [x] check query behaviour in commandbar (use debounced query for viewfield of type relation)
- [x] handle views in sub list
- [x] add back custom commands
- [x] cannot filter by tasks -> todos
- [x] handle click on list item in sub view
